GettingAndCleanData
===================

course project of  GettingAndCleanData

The run_analysis.R file contains all the analysis I performed to create the two tidy datasets
as required in the course project.

In order to run the code, just need to put this run_analysis.R file together with
the unzipped folder named UCI HAR Dataset all in the working directory. Folder
UCI HAR Dataset is directed unzipped from the given zip file getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip
from the project website.

There will be two output. 
File "merged_tidy_dataset.txt" is  the merged training and the test sets with only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
File "average_per_subject_per_activity.txt" is  the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
We also provide a csv version of these two files too.
